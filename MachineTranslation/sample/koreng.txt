they accompany me to market
my friend come from india
they drink orange juice
we meet every morning
he kill that snake
she sleep at my house
my monkey eat banana
i cook fried potato
they plant that flower
I learn many from my surrounding
Life is short but beautiful
If you not ever try you will not ever know
Chat with you make me happy
it is heavy rain
One step again
Read book increase knowledge
Will you miss me when I am gone
Share is care
the apple was cut by me
my mother buy me a new bicycle
her cat died yesterday
my auntie is a singer
i like sweet food

She want eat
He likes you
You can fly
I just want dance
A duck drink in river
That red car is mine
Good job
I need you
You need me
My bird was death
Fly away
Catch me if you can
I miss you
You miss him
You think you real cool
they call a doctor
Just one day
Sugar free
Low fat
Healthy life
I swear
Follow me
How to make noodle
I feel free
That black paper is yours
Like a small boat on the ocean
Good luck
Can you hear my heart this time
Can not stop
Female president
You make me feel beautiful
If you do
Why so serious
Wait for a love like this
we say hello
Heart attack
When I was your man
It will rain
Sky full of star
Stupid action
If this was a movie
I will not ever let you down
Give me a reason
We can learn to sing again
Pray to god
tiger run fast
sheep eat grass
Cow produce milk and meat
That ghost hugs a girl
Let me introduce my self to you
i hate pop song
i sell new purple gown
love is an open the door
if this is my last night with you
hold me like i more than just a friend
